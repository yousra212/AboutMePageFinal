    <h3>Funny Story</h3>

    <p>When I was a student in primary school, we had a Mathematics test that I didn't study. <br>
        So during the test, I decided to cheat on the test. The thing is I'm really bad at cheating. <br>
        I copied on my friend EVERTHING including the name. Instead of writting my name, I wrote the name of my friend. <br>
        Of course, the teacher noticed and I got my first 0.</p>
